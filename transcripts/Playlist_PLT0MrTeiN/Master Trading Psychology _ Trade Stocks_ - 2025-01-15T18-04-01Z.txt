trading psychology and coping with
emotions
we've covered many aspects of trading
from Trading setups through to risk
reward and risk management but we only
Loosely cover mindset psychology and
thinking in terms of probabilities
arguably the most important components
of becoming a successful Trader
many different character traits appear
throughout the career of a Trader from
Fear anger confusion despair through to
overconfidence but the key trait for a
successful Trader is to trade without
emotion
Technical and fundamental analysis will
only take us so far being able to adopt
the right mental state and therefore
trading with a zen-like mentality is the
differentiating factor
let's take a look and if you do find

most gamblers will approach the roulette
table with a positive mentality but is
subconsciously aware that even when a
bet is placed there is a chance that
they could lose but deep down the
Gambler does not expect to lose they
have a bias of winning expectancy
otherwise why place a bet in the first
place
when this ingrained false expectation
materializes into a string of unexpected
losses true emotions begin to appear
positivity turns into heightened focus
and then disbelief anger and finally
despair
on the other hand the casino owner
Embraces the fact that the gamblers
could have a winning streak and this
could result in the casino having a
losing day or even a losing week but the
casino has a confirmed Edge and over a
large volume of bets placed they know
they will win losses are just part of
the business
the same principle exists in trading
every Trader is aware that when a trade
is entered there is an element of risk
either the full position or the stop
loss portion
but as every Trader really accept the
risk or even think that they will lose
money on this new trade
the expectation of most Traders is for
price to continue its trajectory whilst
making money
in reality however the opposite often
happens
when these failed trades happen several
times consecutively in a short period
the trader becomes disillusioned and
realization confirms a psychological Gap
from assuming they accepted the risk to
disbelief when a series of fails trades
occur
the best traders in the world know that
the next trade is a random event
therefore a sequence of random events
could lead to a sequence of losing
trades
but like the casino owner they
understand this is just part of the
business
the hard cold reality of trading is that
every trade has an uncertain outcome
unless you learn to completely accept
the possibility of an uncertain outcome
it will be very hard to succeed as a
Trader
you must accept the following to achieve
a zen-like mentality
Anything could happen in the stock
market
you don't need a psychic ability for the
very next trade in order to make money
there is a random distribution between
winning trades and losing trades that
ultimately Define a statistical Edge
an edge is simply an indication of
higher probability over a sequence of
events
and finally every event in the stock
market is entirely unique
once these points are fully accepted the
trader can face the markets evolving
uncertainty with a feeling of calm they
don't become unnerved by periods of
drawdown and can therefore trade with
Zen
there's a term commonly referred to as
the gambler's fallacy this refers to an
erroneous belief that a statistically
independent event is influenced by a
previous set of events
let's take a coin toss for example we
know there is a 50 chance of the coin
landing on heads or tails but what if
the coin is tossed a total of four times
and heads appears four times in a row do
you think the next toss is likely to be
heads or tails
the answer of course is that there is
still a 50 chance of either
the coin has no memory the previous coin
tosses have absolutely no relevance to
the next coin toss
on this occasion The Gambler who loaded
his stake up on Tails would have lost
and despite his belief he did not have
an improved probability on the next toss
to justify a larger stake
this fallacy often Finds Its way into
the stock Trader's mindset not only is
the trader surprised by his first trade
being a losing trade but he's left in
disbelief that all his five trades were
losers
he assumes his selection process was
wrong or the market is rigged against
him
conversely all his five trades could be
winners and he then feels he has the
perfect trading method
in either scenario the sample size is
far too small to make any judgment on
the long-term success of the strategy
take my strategy for example I've had
losing periods but over the longer term
my Edge always materializes losing
trades in the short term must be
accepted and should be factored into a
foundation of expectation
a previous video takes this concept A
step further
the key message here is that regardless
of the outcome of the previous event or
events there is no influence whatsoever
on the very next event
every singular event is completely
independent of one another you must
fully accept that the very next trade is
completely random a trait that is
inherently difficult to comprehend
expecting a random outcome however does
not mean that with discipline and
practice you can't improve your
probability of success
combining focus and regimentally
following your process can lead to
hitting your target more often than not
just be prepared not to risk too much on
each trade an inevitable losing run will
come and could blow up your account if
the stakes are too high
at this point you fully embrace the
market from a probabilistic perspective
you know that the very next trade or
series of Trades could be losers
you also know that through your Edge
that over a larger volume of Trades
placed consistently you're likely to
make a profit and you therefore size
your positions accordingly to enable
your Edge to materialize
it's important to note that Carefree
means confident but not euphoric
when you have a zen-like mentality you
won't feel any fear hesitation or desire
to do anything
because you've effectively eliminated
Market information as being threatening
when you've accepted the risk you'll be
at peace with any trading outcome
you are now trading with Zen
there are several principles that allow
your Carefree state of mind and
statistical Edge to play out and
therefore become a winner
firstly objectively identify your Edge
for example your back testing process
may have identified a breakout strategy
whereby three pivot Points form a
resistance line and thereafter the price
is seen as breaking through the
resistance
this could be classed as an objective
reason to place a trade
next you must pre-define your risk
perhaps by placing a stop loss within
the breakout Channel again often
established through your back testing
study
thirdly you must completely accept the
risk and not be surprised if the trade
loses you act upon your Edge or strategy
without reservation or hesitation
you win only if the market allows and
you can't force a trade
you continually Monitor and accept your
ability of making errors and finally you
understand the principles of consistent
success and therefore you always follow
them
author of trading in the zone Mark
Douglas says 95 percent of the trading
errors you are likely to make causing
the money to just evaporate before your
eyes will stem from your attitudes about
being wrong
losing money missing out and leaving
money on the table
what I call the four primary trading
fears
fears of this nature will inhibit your
Carefree state of mind and prevent you
from Trading with a zen-like mentality
free your mind from the beliefs that
prevent you from Trading without emotion
and remember anything can happen embrace
the unexpected
trade consistently without fear Embrace
risk understand probability and let go
of your fears whilst developing
objective discipline
